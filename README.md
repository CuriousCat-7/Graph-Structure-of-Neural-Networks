## Graph
### Graph Generator
![cluster coefficient and average path length](./figures/all_path_cluster.png)
1. Generate Graphs
```bash
python -m nx_ops.create create_all
```
2. Analyse Clustering coeffient and average length.

Use pandas and draw graphs by ipython, like:
```python
import pandas
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
df_ws = pd.read_csv("save/ws_path_cluster.png")
df_ws.dropna().sample(4000).plot.scatter("cluster_coefficient", "avg_path_length",alpha=0.25, color="yellow", ax=ax, label="WS")
```
