## Graph
1. Generat Graphs
```bash
python -m nx_ops.create create_all
```
2. Analyse Clustering coeffient and average length.

Use pandas and draw graphs like:
```python
df_ws.dropna().sample(4000).plot.scatter("cluster_coefficient", "avg_path_length",alpha=0.25, color="yellow", ax=ax, label="WS")
```
etc, get
![cluster coefficient and average path length](./figures/all_path_cluster.png)
